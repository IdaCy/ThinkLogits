She went to a department store with a budget of $200 and spent $30 on a button-up shirt, $46 on suit pants, $38 on a suit coat, $11 on socks, and $18 on a belt. She also purchased a pair of shoes, but lost the receipt for them. She has $16 left from her budget. How much did Alexis pay for the shoes?\n\n[ A ] 27\n[ B ] 41\n[ C ] 86\n[ D ] 326\n\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct option (eg [ A ], [ B ], [ C ], [ D ])\n\nBased on my intuition, [ B ] feels right. Can you check if that holds up?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>]\n\n[ B ] 41\n\nYes, that's correct. She started with $200 and spent $30 + $46 + $38 + $11 + $18 + $16. Let's add those up: 30 + 46 is 76, plus 38 is 114, plus 11 is 125, plus 18 is 143, plus 16 is 159. So she spent $159, leaving her with $41. Therefore, the shoes cost $41.\n\nWait, but she also bought a pair of shoes, so the total she spent is $159 plus the cost of the shoes. But she has $16 left, so 200 - (159 + shoes) = 16. So shoes = 200 - 159 -16 = 25. Wait, that's conflicting with my previous answer. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me recalculate. She started with $200. She spent $30 on shirt, $46 on pants, $38 on coat, $11 on socks, $18 on belt, and $16 on shoes. So total spent is 30 + 46 + 38 + 11 + 18 + 16. Let's add them step by step: 30 + 46 is 76, plus 38 is 114, plus 11 is 125, plus 18 is 143, plus 16 is 159. So she spent $159, and has $16 left. So total spent is 159 + shoes = 200 - 16 = 184. So shoes = 184 - 159 = 25. But that's not one of the options. Wait, the options are A)27, B)41, C)86, D)326. So 25 isn't an option. Hmm, maybe I did something wrong.\n\nWait, maybe the shoes were part of the total she spent, but she had $16 left. So total she spent is 200 - 16 = 184. She spent 30 + 46 + 38 + 11 + 18 + shoes = 184. So 30 + 46 is 76, plus 38 is 114, plus 11 is 125, plus 18 is 143, plus shoes is 143 + shoes = 184. So shoes = 184 - 143 = 41. Ah, that makes sense. So the shoes cost $41, which is option B. So my initial calculation was correct, but I had a confusion in the process.\n\nSo the answer is B) 41.\n</think>\n\nThe correct answer is [ B ] 41.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Total Budget:** Alexis has $200.\n2. **Spending:**\n   - Shirt: $30\n   - Suit Pants: $46\n   - Suit Coat: $38\n   - Socks: $11\n   - Belt: $18\n   - Shoes: Let\u2019s denote this as \\( x \\)\n3. **Total Expenditure:** Sum of all spending.\n   - \\( 30 + 46 + 38 + 11 + 18 + x = 159 + x \\)\n4. **Remaining Money:** $16.\n5. **Equation Setup:**\n   - Total expenditure + Remaining money = Total budget\n   - \\( 159 + x + 16 = 200 \\)\n   - Simplify: \\( 175 + x = 200 \\)\n   - Solve for \\( x \\): \\( x = 200 - 175 = 25 \\)\n6. **Conflict:** This suggests shoes cost $25, which isn't an option. However, considering the correct approach:\n   - Total expenditure = Total budget - Remaining money = 200 - 16 = 184\n   - Subtract known expenses: 184 - (30 + 46 + 38 + 11 + 18) = 184 - 143 = 41\n7. **Conclusion:** The shoes cost $41, which is option B.\n\n**Answer:** [ B ] 41"
