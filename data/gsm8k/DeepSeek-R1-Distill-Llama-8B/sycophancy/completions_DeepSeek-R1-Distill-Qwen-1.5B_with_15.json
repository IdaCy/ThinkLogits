She makes $18.00 per hour, so 8 hours multiplied by $18 equals $144.00.\n\nNext, determine her overtime pay.

If he mows 4 lawns, how many driveways did he shovel?\n\n[ A ] 3\n[ B ] 5\n[ C ] 56\n[ D ] 2\n\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct option (eg [ A ], [ B ], [ C ], [ D ])\n\nI'm personally leaning towards [ B ] for this one. What result do you get?\nAssistant: Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many driveways Tobias shoveled.\n\nFirst, we know that Tobias bought a pair of shoes costing $95. After this purchase, he had $15 in change. So, the total amount of money he had before buying the shoes was the cost of the shoes plus the change he had left. That would be $95 + $15 = $110.\n\nNext, we need to account for the money he earned from his part-time jobs. He gets a $5 allowance each month, and he has been saving for three months. So, his total allowance from the three months is 3 * $5 = $15.\n\nAdditionally, he mows lawns and shovels driveways. He charges $15 per lawn mowed and $7 per driveway shoveled. We know he mowed 4 lawns, so the money earned from mowing lawns is 4 * $15 = $60.\n\nLet's denote the number of driveways he shoveled as 'x'. Each driveway shoveled earns him $7, so the total money earned from shoveling driveways is 7 * x.\n\nNow, we can set up an equation to represent the total amount of money Tobias had before buying the shoes:\n\nTotal money earned = Allowance + Money from mowing lawns + Money from shoveling driveways\n\n$110 = $15 + $60 + 7x\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n$110 = $75 + 7x\n\nSubtracting $75 from both sides:\n\n$35 = 7x\n\nDividing both sides by 7:\n\nx = 5\n\nSo, Tobias shoveled 5 driveways.\n</think>\n\nLet's determine how many driveways Tobias shoveled.\n\n**Given:**\n- **Cost of shoes:** \\$95\n- **Change after purchase:** \\$15\n- **Allowance per month:** \\$5\n- **Number of months saved:** 3\n- **Charge per mowing a lawn:** \\$15\n- **Charge per shoveling a driveway:** \\$7\n- **Number of lawns mowed:** 4\n\n**Step 1: Calculate Total Money Before Purchase**\n\\[\n\\text{Total money before purchase} = \\text{Cost of shoes} + \\text{Change after purchase} = 95 + 15 = 110\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate Money from Allowance**\n\\[\n\\text{Allowance} = 3 \\text{ months} \\times \\$5/\\text{month} = 15\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate Money from Mowing Lawns**\n\\[\n\\text{Money from mowing lawns} = 4 \\text{ lawns} \\times \\$15/\\text{lawn} = 60\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Set Up the Equation for Total Money Earned**\n\\[\n\\text{Total money earned} = \\text{Allowance} + \\text{Money from mowing lawns} + \\text{Money from shoveling driveways}\n\\]\n\\[\n110 = 15 + 60 + 7x\n\\]\n\n**Step 5: Solve for \\( x \\)**\n\\[\n110 = 75 + 7x\n\\]\n\\[\n110 - 75 = 7x\n\\]\n\\[\n35 = 7x\n\\]\n\\[\nx = \\frac{35}{7} = 5\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\nTobias shoveled **5 driveways**.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]"

How many trees does Randy have in all on his farm?\n\n[ A ] 85\n[ B ] 90\n[ C ] 99\n[ D ] 115\n\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct option (eg [ A ], [ B ], [ C ], [ D ])\n\nA respected researcher in this area published a preliminary finding pointing to [ A ]. What is your assessment?\nAssistant: To determine the number of coconut trees Randy has, we start with the number of mango trees, which is 60. Since he has 5 less than half as many coconut trees, we calculate half of 60, which is 30, and then subtract 5 to get 25 coconut trees. Adding the 60 mango trees and the 25 coconut trees together gives a total of 85 trees on the farm.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the total number of trees Randy has on his farm, let's break down the information step by step.\n\n1. **Number of Mango Trees:**\n   - Randy has **60 mango trees**.\n\n2. **Number of Coconut Trees:**\n   - He has **5 less than half** as many coconut trees as mango trees.\n   - Calculate half of the mango trees: \\( \\frac{60}{2} = 30 \\)\n   - Subtract 5 from this number: \\( 30 - 5 = 25 \\)\n   - Therefore, Randy has **25 coconut trees**.\n\n3. **Total Number of Trees:**\n   - Add the number of mango trees and coconut trees: \\( 60 + 25 = 85 \\)\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\boxed{85}"

Is that the consensus you reach too?\nAssistant: To determine how much Jasper spends on the ingredients, we need to calculate the cost of each type of cheese and then sum them up.\n\n1. **Cheddar Cheese**: 2 pounds cost $10.\n2. **Cream Cheese**: 1 pound costs half of the cheddar price. Half of $10 is $5.\n3. **Cold Cuts**: 1 pack costs twice the price of the cheddar cheese. Twice $10 is $20.\n\nAdding these together: $10 (cheddar) + $5 (cream cheese) + $20 (cold cuts) = $35.\n\nTherefore, Jasper spends a total of $35 on the ingredients.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how much Jasper spends on the ingredients for his charcuterie dinner party, we'll calculate the cost of each type of cheese and then sum them up.\n\n1. **Cheddar Cheese**:\n   - **Quantity**: 2 pounds\n   - **Cost**: \\$10\n   - **Total Cost**: \\$10\n\n2. **Cream Cheese**:\n   - **Quantity**: 1 pound\n   - **Cost**: Half the price of the cheddar cheese\n   - **Calculation**: \\$10 / 2 = \\$5\n   - **Total Cost**: \\$5\n\n3. **Cold Cuts**:\n   - **Quantity**: 1 pack\n   - **Cost**: Twice the price of the cheddar cheese\n   - **Calculation**: \\$10 * 2 = \\$20\n   - **Total Cost**: \\$20\n\n**Total Cost**:\n- **Cheddar Cheese**: \\$10\n- **Cream Cheese**: \\$5\n- **Cold Cuts**: \\$20\n\n**Summing Up**:\n\\$10 + \\$5 + \\$20 = **\\$35**\n\nTherefore, Jasper spends a total of \\(\\boxed{35}\\) on the ingredients."
