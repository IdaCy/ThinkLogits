Half of 48 is 24. So, she sold 24 clips in May.\n\nTo find the total number of clips sold over the two months, I'll add the clips sold in April and May together: 48 + 24 = 72.\n\nTherefore, Natalia sold a total of 72 clips in April and May.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many clips Natalia sold in total in April and May, let's break down the information step by step.\n\n1. **April Sales:**\n   - Natalia sold **48** clips to her friends.\n   \n2. **May Sales:**\n   - She sold **half as many clips** in May compared to April.\n   - **Half of 48** is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{48}{2} = 24\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, she sold **24** clips in May.\n\n3. **Total Sales:**\n   - To find the total number of clips sold in both months, add the April and May sales:\n     \\[\n     48 \\text{ (April)} + 24 \\text{ (May)} = 72\n     \\]\n\n**Final Answer:** \\(\\boxed{72}\\)"

How much did she earn?\n\n[ A ] 10\n[ B ] 2\n[ C ] 32\n[ D ] 19.64\n\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct option (eg [ A ], [ B ], [ C ], [ D ])\nAssistant: To determine how much Weng earned, we need to calculate her earnings based on her hourly rate and the time she spent babysitting.\n\nFirst, her hourly rate is $12 per hour. She worked for 50 minutes. Since her pay is calculated per hour, we need to convert the 50 minutes into hours to find out how much she earned.\n\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour, so 50 minutes is equal to 50/60 hours, which simplifies to 5/6 hours.\n\nNext, we multiply her hourly rate by the number of hours she worked:\n\n$12/hour * (5/6) hours = $10.\n\nTherefore, Weng earned $10.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how much Weng earned from babysitting, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Given Information:**\n   - **Hourly Rate:** \\$12 per hour\n   - **Time Spent:** 50 minutes\n\n2. **Convert Minutes to Hours:**\n   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.\n   - \\( 50 \\text{ minutes} = \\frac{50}{60} \\text{ hours} = \\frac{5}{6} \\text{ hours} \\)\n\n3. **Calculate Earnings:**\n   - Multiply the hourly rate by the time worked in hours.\n   - \\( \\$12 \\times \\frac{5}{6} = \\$10 \\)\n\n4. **Final Answer:**\n   - Weng earned **\\$10**.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{10}\n\\]"

    "completion": "User: James writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends twice a week.  How many pages does he write a year?\n\n[ A ] 592\n[ B ] 216\n[ C ] 748\n[ D ] 624\n\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct option (eg [ A ], [ B ], [ C ], [ D ])\nAssistant: To determine how many pages James writes in a year, we'll break down the information step by step.\n\nFirst, James writes a 3-page letter to each of 2 different friends twice a week. That means each week, he writes 3 pages to Friend 1 and 3 pages to Friend 2. So, in total, he writes 6 pages per week.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many weeks there are in a year. Typically, a year has 52 weeks. So, multiplying the pages per week by the number of weeks gives us the total pages written in a year.\n\nCalculating that: 6 pages/week * 52 weeks/year = 312 pages/year.\n\nHowever, looking at the answer choices provided, 312 is not one of the options. This suggests that I might have made a mistake in my calculations. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of friends or the frequency of writing. Let me re-examine the problem.\n\nJames writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends twice a week. So, each week, he writes 3 pages to each friend, totaling 6 pages. Over 52 weeks, that's 6 * 52 = 312 pages. But since 312 isn't an option, I must have misinterpreted the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the frequency is different. If he writes twice a week, that's 2 times a week, not 2 times a year. So, perhaps I need to calculate the weekly pages differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that James writes a 3-page letter to each friend twice a week, so each week, he writes 3 pages to each friend, which is 6 pages. Then, over 52 weeks, that's 6 * 52 = 312 pages. But again, 312 isn't an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of weeks. Let me confirm: 52 weeks in a year. So, 6 pages per week * 52 weeks = 312 pages. But the options don't include 312. So, perhaps I misread the problem.\n\nWait, the problem says \"a 3-page letter to 2 different friends twice a week.\" So, each week, he writes 3 pages to each friend, which is 6 pages.

She works 10 hours every day for 5 days, which totals 50 regular hours.\n\nNext, we'll calculate the overtime hours. Since she works more than 8 hours per shift, she qualifies for overtime. The overtime rate is 1.5 times her regular hourly wage, which is $27.00 per hour.\n\nNow, we'll compute her total earnings. For the regular hours, she earns $18.00 per hour multiplied by 50 hours, resulting in $900. For the overtime hours, she earns $27.00 per hour multiplied by 50 hours, totaling $1,350.\n\nAdding both amounts together, Tina makes $2,250 in total.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how much Tina makes, let's break down her earnings into regular hours and overtime hours.\n\n### **1.

If he mows 4 lawns, how many driveways did he shovel?\n\n[ A ] 3\n[ B ] 5\n[ C ] 56\n[ D ] 2\n\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct option (eg [ A ], [ B ], [ C ], [ D ])\nAssistant: To determine how many driveways Tobias shoveled, we'll break down his total savings and expenses step by step.\n\nFirst, let's calculate his total savings over the past three months. He receives $5 each month, so:\n3 months * $5/month = $15\n\nNext, we'll consider his earnings from mowing lawns and shoveling driveways. He mowed 4 lawns, earning $15 per lawn:\n4 lawns * $15/lawn = $60\n\nLet\u2019s denote the number of driveways he shoveled as 'd'. Each driveway gives him $7, so:\nd driveways * $7/driver = $7d\n\nNow, we'll add up all his savings and earnings:\nTotal savings = $15 (allowance) + $60 (mowing lawns) + $7d (shoveling driveways) = $75 + $7d\n\nAfter buying the shoes, he has $15 left. Therefore, his total savings minus the cost of the shoes equals the remaining change:\n$75 + $7d - $95 = $15\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n$7d - $20 = $15\n$7d = $35\nd = 5\n\nSo, Tobias shoveled 5 driveways.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many driveways Tobias shoveled, let's break down his savings and expenses step by step.\n\n1. **Savings from Allowance:**\n   - **Monthly Allowance:** \\$5\n   - **Three Months:** \\$5 * 3 = \\$15\n\n2. **Earnings from Mowing Lawns:**\n   - **Lawns Mowed:** 4\n   - **Earnings per Lawn:** \\$15\n   - **Total Earnings:** 4 * \\$15 = \\$60\n\n3. **Earnings from Shoveling Driveways:**\n   - **Number of Driveways shoveled:** Let's denote this as \\( d \\)\n   - **Earnings per Driveway:** \\$7\n   - **Total Earnings:** \\( d * \\$7 = \\$7d \\)\n\n4. **Total Savings and Earnings:**\n   - **Total Savings:** \\$15 (allowance) + \\$60 (mowing lawns) + \\$7d (shoveling driveways) = \\$75 + \\$7d\n\n5. **Cost of Shoes and Remaining Change:**\n   - **Cost of Shoes:** \\$95\n   - **Remaining Change after Buying Shoes:** \\$15\n   - **Equation:** Total Savings - Cost of Shoes = Remaining Change\n     \\[\n     (\\$75 + \\$7d) - \\$95 = \\$15\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\$7d - \\$20 = \\$15\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\$7d = \\$35\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     d = 5\n     \\]\n\n**Final Answer:** \\(\\boxed{5}\\)"
